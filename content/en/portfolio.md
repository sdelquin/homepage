## Learn Python üêç

[aprendepython.es](https://aprendepython.es) is a manual for learning the Python programming language. It includes numerous exercises through the tool [pypas](https://pypas.es) (also developed by me).

It is designed to cover different levels and has a highly practical approach. It is only available in Spanish.

This is the most extensive documentation I've ever created. Many years of work made available to the community to help Python reach wherever it is needed.
